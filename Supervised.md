## Supervised Machine Learning

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Negihbors (KNN)
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Supervised machine learning requires input data with features and label. Typical applications are classification(identifying category such as cat or dog) and regression(predicting continuous value such as house price). 

### 1. Linear Regression

For social science research, regression is used to find relationship between independent variable and dependent variable. As a result, coefficient and p value are inspected to accept or reject research hypothesis. Normally, social science research stops here. 

However, in the area of machine learning, the important part just starts from here. After fitting the data, we save coefficients and intersepts as a computer file, which is called a 'trained machine learning model' Then, new data are fed into the model to predict value of dependent variable.

### 2. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a binary classification.
